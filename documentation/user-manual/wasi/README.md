# WASI runtime

Set `PANNONICO_FORCE_WASI=1` to select the portable artifact explicitly:

```text
PANNONICO_FORCE_WASI=1 npx pannonico build site
```

The launcher automatically falls back to WASI only when the native member is
missing or the Node host platform and architecture are unsupported. It verifies
the WASI member before execution and reports one of these reasons on standard
error:

- `native-artifact-missing`
- `unsupported-native-host`

The exact automatic-fallback line is:

```text
pannonico: using WASI fallback (reason=<reason>)
```

A malformed manifest, unsafe member path, symlink, non-file, checksum mismatch,
target mismatch, native start failure, or missing selected WASI member is a
hard error. Forced WASI is not reported as an automatic fallback.

For a positional file, the host preopens its real parent and forwards the file
identity below `/project`. For a directory, it preopens that project at
`/project`. Absolute and relative path options must remain inside the one
preopen, including local `--data` inputs. The host recognizes `--data-url`
syntax, but both WASI editions reject native-only remote data. Native-only
commands return Pannonico exit status `4`.

The WASI host does not create a missing scaffold root. Create the directory
before a forced or automatic-fallback scaffold command:

```text
mkdir site
PANNONICO_FORCE_WASI=1 npx pannonico scaffold --min site
```

The host forwards only `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` and preserves standard streams and
exit status.
